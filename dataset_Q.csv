"good text 1";"Will Ferrell is set to turn his 2020 comedy Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga into a Broadway musical. The actor starred in and co-wrote the Netflix film with Harper Steele and the pair will develop the show with Anthony King, whose Broadway credits include Beetlejuice and Gutenberg! The Musical!. There is no timeline yet to the production. We are more than excited to bring Eurovision to Broadway, Ferrell said in a statement. The stage musical is a perfect place to continue our celebration of all the things we love about this amazing and unifying song competition. The film was released on Netflix in June 2020 and followed a pair of Icelandic singers, played by Ferrell and Rachel McAdams, as they took part in Eurovision. It received an Oscar nomination for best original song. It received mixed reviews upon release with the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw calling it a strange, tonally misfiring movie. This is a stellar team for what I am sure will be an equally stellar adaption of a film the world loved, said Martin Green, CBE director of the Eurovision Song Contest. Our aim always is to bring the joy of the Eurovision Song Contest to more people globally – especially as we approach our 70th edition in 2026. The show will be directed by Alex Timber who is currently behind the Tony-nominated Bobby Darin musical Just in Time. This year’s Eurovision Song Contest was watched by 166 million people worldwide. Ferrell and Steele recently starred in the acclaimed documentary Will & Harper, a road trip documentary about their friendship. Ferrell also starred in comedy You’re Cordially Invited earlier this year and is currently filming comedy Judgment Day with Zac Efron and Regina Hall."
"good text 2";"I was in Oklahoma City last month as the Thunder clinched their Western Conference semi-final against the Nuggets in Game 7, and saw first-hand the Thunder run Denver off the court. The game wasn’t even close. The Thunder outplayed them on both sides of the court. Defensively, Thunder coach Mark Daigneault put the 6ft 5in Alex Caruso on in the 6ft 11in Nikola Jokić and, surprisingly, it worked. With Chet Holmgren or Isaiah Hartenstein providing help-side support, I watched a frustrated Jokić struggle to get to his spots. His usual tricks – flopping, drawing fouls – didn’t work. The Thunder defense moved in perfect sync, and it completely disrupted Denver’s rhythm. It was absolutely beautiful to watch. The Thunder’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was named league MVP shortly afterwards, beating Jokić into second, and he thoroughly deserved the award. Their superior defense was on display again in the Western Conference finals against the Minnesota Timberwolves. In the Game 5 win that sealed the Thunder’s progress to the NBA finals, I watched them destroy the Timberwolves and defense was once again the key. Minnesota’s Anthony Edwards described the Thunder’s defense as: One string, 15 puppets on one string. That’s what’s driven their rise all year. In a league where defense is often overlooked or criticized, the Thunder have made it their identity. And now, they’re just four wins away from an NBA title. But as I have been enjoying this current Thunder team, I can’t help but think back to the Thunder team I played for in 2010. The Thunder are heavily favored to beat the Indiana Pacers in the NBA finals, which start on Thursday, and they are the youngest team to ever make the finals since … the Thunder did so with a whole different cast in 2012. But I can say with 100% confidence, that if the Thunder kept that team – with Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka – they would have won multiple championships."

Meanwhile, the juxtaposition of surrealist art and existential philosophy evokes a profound dissonance, compelling the observer to reconcile the absurdity of meaning with the inherent search for purpose.

Meanwhile, in a nearby café, patrons engaged in animated discussions over steaming cups of coffee, their conversations weaving a tapestry of ideas and opinions that spanned topics as diverse as the latest scientific breakthroughs, the nuances of classical literature, and the ever-evolving landscape of modern art, creating an intellectual atmosphere that was both invigorating and overwhelming, as the aroma of freshly baked pastries mingled with the scent of roasted beans, enveloping the space in a comforting embrace."
