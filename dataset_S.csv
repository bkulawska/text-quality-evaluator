"children";"I live in a house near the mountains. I have two brothers and one sister, and I was born last. My father teaches mathematics, and my mother is a nurse at a big hospital. My brothers are very smart and work hard in school. My sister is a nervous girl, but she is very kind. My grandmother also lives with us. She came from Italy when I was two years old. She has grown old, but she is still very strong. She cooks the best food! My family is very important to me. We do lots of things together. My brothers and I like to go on long walks in the mountains. My sister likes to cook with my grandmother. On the weekends we all play board games together. We laugh and always have a good time. I love my family very much."
"teenagers";"You’ve been slathering on your go-to facial moisturizer with twice-daily rigor. No matter how liberally you lotion up, though, your skin still feels like it’s stuck in an ultra-arid desert. Sound familiar? These can be signs of dehydrated skin. For many of us, dry skin can feel like a mystery that goes on unsolved no matter how many steps we add to our skin care routines. Sure, there’s the seasonal element; due to drops in temperature and humidity, skin has a harder time retaining moisture in colder months, per the American Academy of Dermatology Association (and per pretty much anyone who’s experienced a cold winter before). In your case, though, you get the feeling that you may not be moisturizing well or enough, regardless of the season. After all, what else could be causing your face to so often feel this parched? Before you panic-buy another cream or serum, we asked dermatologists and other skin care experts to help us peek under the hood and understand what really causes facial skin’s moisture levels to act moody. What they told us is that persistent dryness often has a lot to do with how much (or little) hydration your skin has."
"adults with basic or secondary education";"On the morning of August 16, 2017, Antonio Navarro Cerdán, a 36-year-old industrial engineer, left his home to go to work in Valencia, Spain. He lived in the Patraix neighborhood with his wife, María Jesús Moreno Cantó—known as Maje. Antonio never even started the car: he was ambushed in the building’s garage by a man who had been hiding among the vehicles. Stabbed in the chest, he died at the scene. From the start, police ruled out robbery as a motive—nothing had been taken. The case quickly took a dark turn, revealing a carefully orchestrated plot, with the widow Maje at its center. This real-life story of betrayal, manipulation, and premeditated murder inspired the new Spanish thriller A Widow’s Game (La Viuda Negra), premiering May 30 on Netflix. Here’s everything you need to know about the true crime behind the Netflix film."
"adults with higher education";"With the ubiquity of new information technology and media, more effective and friendly methods for human computer interaction (HCI) are being developed which do not rely on traditional devices such as keyboards, mice, and displays. Furthermore, the ever decreasing price/performance ratio of computing coupled with recent decreases in video image acquisition cost imply that computer vision systems can be deployed in desktop and embedded systems. The rapidly expanding research in face processing is based on the premise that information about a user’s identity, state, and intent can be extracted from images, and that computers can then react accordingly, e.g., by observing a person’s facial expression. In the last five years, face and facial expression recognition have attracted much attention though they have been studied for more than 20 years by psychophysicists, neuroscientists, and engineers. Many research demonstrations and commercial applications have been developed from these efforts. A first step of any face processing system is detecting the locations in images where faces are present. However, face detection from a single image is a challenging task because of variability in scale, location, orientation (up-right, rotated), and pose (frontal, profile). Facial expression, occlusion, and lighting conditions also change the overall appearance of faces."
"adults learning language";"My job is a long distance from my home, almost 50 miles away. I have to wake up early every morning, as I’m always in a rush. There’s never enough time for a relaxed breakfast. At exactly 6:00 AM, I get into my car and start the long drive. I usually like driving on the highway more than in the city. During the morning rush hour, though, it’s not very enjoyable. The heavy traffic is a little bit annoying. So I always listen to my favorite classical music CD’s in the car – Chopin, Mozart, and Bach. That cheers me up a lot. The drive to work takes about one hour. Going back home in the evening after work takes even longer, maybe around 70 minutes. Lately I’ve been thinking about trying to take the train to work instead of driving. That way, I could still listen to my music with headphones, and even read a novel at the same time."
"seniors";"Your grandma always remembers your birthday (gotta love grandmas!) and faithfully sends a card with a little cash tucked inside. But this year? Nada. No card. No cash. No sparkly sticker-covered envelope. Did Grandma forget? (Never!) Did it get lost in the mail? Or … did some lowlife snatch it right out of your mailbox and is now using your birthday money to buy gas station snacks? You may have been hit by a mail thief—or as they’re known in the wild, porch pirates—and they’re becoming both more prolific and more bold in their crimes. In 2024, more than 58 million people in the U.S. reported stolen packages, adding up to a jaw-dropping $13 billion in losses. Mail theft has exploded in recent years, thanks to a perfect storm of online-shopping overload and a sharp rise in check-fraud scams. It’s gotten so bad that the United States Postal Service (USPS) has been sounding the alarm. Your mail security is of paramount importance for the Postal Service, and we take it very seriously, says Philip Bogenberger, a USPS spokesperson and communications specialist. Mail theft is a federal crime, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, which is the law enforcement arm of the Postal Service, investigates thousands of crimes each year involving the mail."
